Professional SEO Audit Toolkit (GitHub Actions)
This toolkit is a powerful, two-part system designed to help you quickly perform SEO audits and generate professional, client-ready reports, fully automated via GitHub Actions.
The system consists of a single Python script:
seo_audit.py: This script performs a complete on-page and technical SEO audit, then automatically generates a professional Markdown report.
Features
Fully Automated: Run the entire audit and report generation with a single click in your GitHub repository.
Technical Auditing: Checks for a robots.txt file, page load time, canonical tags, and mobile-friendliness.
On-Page Analysis: Analyzes meta titles, meta descriptions, heading structure, link counts, and content word count. Also detects and lists broken links on the page.
Automated Reporting: Generates a clean, readable report as a Markdown file.
Requirements
GitHub Repository: The code must be in a GitHub repository to use GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions: Your repository must have the workflow file provided in workflow.md.
