Professional SEO Audit Toolkit
This toolkit is a powerful, two-part system designed to help freelancers and digital marketers quickly perform SEO audits and generate professional, client-ready reports.
The system consists of two main components:
seo_audit.py: A Python script that performs a technical and on-page SEO audit on a single URL and saves the findings to a structured JSON file.
report_generator.html: A web-based application that reads the JSON data and uses AI to generate a comprehensive, personalized, and actionable SEO report in a clean, readable format.
Features
Technical Auditing: Checks for a robots.txt file, page load time, canonical tags, and mobile-friendliness.
On-Page Analysis: Analyzes meta titles, meta descriptions, heading structure, link counts, and content word count. Also detects and lists broken links on the page.
Automated Reporting: Uses AI to interpret the audit data and write a detailed report, saving you time and effort.
Easy-to-Use Workflow: Designed for a seamless process from data collection to report generation.
